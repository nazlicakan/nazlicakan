# hi, i'm nazlı 🌙

mis graduate with a love-hate relationship with spreadsheets.  

💡 interested in creative tech, visual data, and design thinking.

currently doing data analysis, system analysis & design, and a bit of statistical magic.  

i speak fluent:
- excel formulas & pivot tables  
- sql joins that actually make sense  
- python 
- power bi dashboards that don’t blind your eyes  

i like clean data, smart systems, and making numbers tell stories.  
half analyst, half detective. full caffeine. ☕  

🐾 (bonus) cats, and late-night coding playlists  

stay tuned! my excel & bi projects are landing here soon.
